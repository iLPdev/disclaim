## Notes
\* Anyone at what venue this was taped?

** Video starts in middle of what is probably the second set, midway through Right Now Today.

*** House lights drop before (r)Evolution and video cuts to 06:50ish, suggesting it's an encore.

**** Timestamp says 4/8/1995, but it's not the same guitar as Anter was playing... is it the one Thad roadies earlier in the video?

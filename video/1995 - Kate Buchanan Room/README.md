This video presents the first place performance of the 1995 _KRFH Battle of the Bands_ sponsored by Radio Free Humboldt. The exact date remains unknown. 

The performance takes place in the Kate Buchanan Room on the campus of Humboldt State University in Arcata, CA. I believe it was filmed by Center Arts.

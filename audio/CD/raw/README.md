The album was recorded and mixed by Fickle Hill Recording Studio in Arcata, CA. 
The band used their monies won from the Humboldt Battle of the Bands to fund it. 
The source CD was duplicated directly from the studio master by Adam Ellis on a Ricoh 1X CD-RW.
I ripped these waveforms from the CD with Exact Audio Copy.

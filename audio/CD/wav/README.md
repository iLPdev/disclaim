* The album was recorded and mixed by Fickle Hill Recording Studio in Arcata, CA. 
* The band used their monies won from the Humboldt Battle of the Bands to fund it. 
* The source CD was duplicated directly from the studio master by Adam Ellis on a Ricoh 1X CD-RW.
* Unfortunately, the CD burner didn't know what to do with the gapless tracks 5, 6, & 7 and the result (see below) was that track 5 was almost 10 minutes long and contained all three tracks.
* Ian ripped these waveforms from the CD with Exact Audio Copy (see errorless secure rip log below).
* Ian split track 5 into the appropriate three tracks (5, 6, and 7) in audacity and updated the metadata.
